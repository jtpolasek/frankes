        The Name Frank E’s is a homage to my father Frank and my brother Erik. The E in the name is for my brother Big E (because
        his son, my nephew, is called little e). Throughout my career and life these two men have always supported me. Sometimes,
        like all relationships between father and sons and brothers, we have had many differences, but throughout it all,
        they have always been there for me. They are both fathers, sons and brothers and I admire them both for various reasons.
        My father has always encouraged me and introduced me to music, books, art and most of all a quality of life that
        helped mold me into who I am today.</p>
      <p class="u-margin-small paragraph dedication__text">My brother is a man who approaches his interests with tenacity and sincerity to get a job well done. He embodies the
        qualities of being a great father that I experienced from our father. This is a thank you to them for always being
        there when I needed them. Telling me what I needed to hear not what I wanted to hear. The shop is the place where
        I can make time stop and we can make time to be together. As a son and brother to these two good men, it makes me
        proud just to be around them.</p>
      <p class="u-margin-small paragraph dedication__text">We all our busy but Frank E’s is a place where a man will be able to, for a period of time, hang his hat and leave
        his troubles at the door, have a sip of whiskey and enjoy the banter of being men. Here I want to create an environment
        where all generations of men can feel at ease, have a great experience and at the same time get a haircut that will
        leave him feeling better than when he came through the door. In this day and age, sometimes everything is too rushed.
        At Frank E’s, quality and the experience is paramount.
